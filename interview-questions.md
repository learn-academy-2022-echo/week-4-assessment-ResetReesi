# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer:

Object-oriented programming is a a computer programming design that helps us developers organize our software designs based on computer data and it's objeacts, instead of functions and logic. The major differnce between object- oriented programming and functional programming is the way each program stores and manipulates its data.  

Researched answer:

Research taught me that you can manipulate data simply by storing it. For example in data forensics in order to maintain the data integity you have to leave the computer on and do not save any files because even truning off the computer can manipulate data. I have never delt with the FBI before, but I watch alot of FBI shows and the FBI never wants you to touch the computer. The FBI believes computer shouldnt be touched and left as is, because once its touched data has been manipulated. As we already know once we manipulate data it losses it's intergrity.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: 

While Floats and Integers are both numberical data types they have different meanings. A float is a any positive or negative number with a decimal point and a Integer is simply a number without a decimal point. When coding if you see the word Int its is the short version for Interger. I typically use floates if I am dividing something with a remainder, but on a daily base I usually use whole numbers which are Integers.

Researched answer: 

After doing more research I found out that floats can be annoying to use becasue of the decimal. Working with decimals can be a pain in the you know what. Ruby has a lot of built in methods such as .round() this will round your float. Another built in method I learned that works well with floats is called .BigDecimal. This method ensures that the number after the decimals will be fixed.

 
3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer:

 There are two types of returns an explicit return and an implicit return, but where going to talk about implicit returns and what that means in ruby world. A Implict return is a return that does not require the word return to log a computer result. With the use of an ixplicit return you can still call a function and that function will display what its told to do while also storing computer data for future use. 



Researched answer:
 
 On my research journey I took a look into explicit returns and found out that explicit returns are the complete opposite of implicit returns. You will need a return in order for the tell a function ('Hey can you deliver this value") after you run the function. when coding its easy to recognized a explicit return, all you have to do is look for the word return after your function. A fun research fact I found out about implicit returns is that it can help you to write shorter code. You can tell the diffrence between inplict and explict with the => (arrow) synatax. An implict return is noticed by the => syntax. Implict function use the arrow syntax simply to replace the traditional function. I have just one more fun fact the about implicts returns. The => (arrow) syntax has many built in meanings, while doing my research I found that pretty cool.




4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer:

A ruby block is no different from any other code block, it's pretty much a group of code. However some of the techniques may differ. for example A ruby block usually starts with the do and end with the word end. Do is were the code starts and end is where the code ends. It also can keep code enclosed the code with {} curly braces. Do and End is usually used for multiple lines of code whereas the {} curly braces is used if your workin with one line of code. All blocks have arguments but the ruby block takes in an argument and that aregument should be defined in between the pipes ||. Ruby blocks do not have to be identified by any name, but you must always pass a method call. 


Researched answer:

Research shows that there is really no diffrence between a ruby block and a method however ruby blocks do not belong to a object. There are only 2 ways to declare a rubly block. Using the DO and End keywords is how ruby blocks are determined. Do is usually placed at the begginig of your block to be repeatedly executes. End it just where you would like your block of code to end. 


5. What is an instance variable in Ruby?

Your answer:

If you ever recognized a variable that start with an @symbol we call this an instance variable in Ruby. Most instance variables are used to give objects there own land to store its data. Ruby instance variable are typically associates with objects and everything in ruby is an object.

Researched answer:

Ruby instance variables are known to be private meaning they are declared outside of an object. Variables that contain an objects are called instance variables. I learned that in ruby we also have instance methods and instance methods are methods that belong to some sort of class but not the whole class it's self. 


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: 

 PostgreSQL is an open source relational database management system ( DBMS ) developed by a worldwide team of volunteers. 

2. Ruby on Rails:

Ruby on the Rails is a framework that helps developers build web applications both front end and back end

3. ORM:

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping and this is a programming technique for converting data between system using object-oriented programming languages.

4. Active Record:

An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulates the data base access, and adds domaon logic on that data

5. Migrations:

Migrations are a feature of active record that allows you to develop your data base design. Migrations help make changes to the data base repeatable,sharable, and testable with out losing your data
